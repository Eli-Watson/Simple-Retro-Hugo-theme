# Simple-Retro-Hugo-theme
A Hugo theme I made for use on my own website. It's super simple (no js) and looks kinda like the "classic" web.

Features:
- Super light weight
- looks like the classic web
- responsive

Installation:
Put it in your themes folder. Config your Hugo config file to point to it. For any advanced stuff just look at my own site bc I'm too lazy to write a full guide for a theme no one is ever gunna use. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
